# livejournal-importer

Modification of LiveJournal Importer plugin for Wordpress supporting import from any LiveJournal-based web site.

The import from livejournal.com does not always work with this plugin. 
However, other LiveJournal-based web sites, such as www.dreamwidth.org, seem to be able to do import from livejournal.com

This modification allows you to import everything from any LiveJournal-based web site into WordPress.
You can also use it for importing from livejournal.com through other LJ-based site. I.e., first import from livejournal.com to dreamwidth.org.
Second, import from dreamwidth.org to WordPress using this plugin.

For the original plugin, please see https://wordpress.org/plugins/livejournal-importer/

### Installation Instructions

* Upload the livejournal-importer folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
* Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
* Go to the Tools -> Import screen, Click on LiveJournal
